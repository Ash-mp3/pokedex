Welcome to my pokedex app!

- you can search any pokemon from the first gen of games.
- you can search by type as well as name.
- click on the pokemon for more info.
- when on a pokemon info page you can cycle through the pokemon
  by using the the arrow buttons at the bottom. As well as with
  the random pokemon button in the header.

- This app was devloped with React.js.
- styled with vanilla and Tailwind.css.
- The free PokeAPI was used for the Pokemon data.

Thanks for stopping by!
